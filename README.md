# MODELING SYSTEMIC INEQUALITY IN LAW ENFORCEMENT

[Run the model here!](https://hash.ai/index/5f397938ceaba295d1929d87/police-brutality-and-inequality)

An agent-based model highlighting the systemic nature of police brutality and distinguishing from the "bad apples" conceptualization. Implicit racial bias and diminishing trust in police are treated as the sole determinants of inequality, ignoring phenomena like hot spots policing, the blue wall of silence, militarization of police forces, the War on Drugs and the definition of a crime, a culture of dehumanization, and legal estrangement within civilian communities.

- Dark yellow cubes:    Civilian agents (committing property crime)
